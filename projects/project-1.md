World of War TankZ was the final project for my first computer science class ICS 111 with professor Jason Leigh.  I designed all the sprite animation for this project, I designed the sprites on piskel.com which is an inbrowser sprite creator, and also wrote the code to animate the sprites with the giffAnime class I created.  We recieved second place int the end of the semester gaming contest for WWTZ. 
This two player battle tank game lets the players drive through a maze and shoot at each other, move around the map and try to gather power ups to gain an advantage over your opponent. Use tactics and ricochet mechanics to outwit the other player. The first player to drop their opponentâ€™s HP to 0 wins the game.
