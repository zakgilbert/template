I had a slight brush with Javascript two summers ago when I attempted to work my way through Marijn Haverbeke’s [“Eloquent Javascript: A Modern Introduction to Programming”](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).  Through the first third of the book I felt fairly comfortable as I had already completed both phases of Introduction to Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa (ICS 111, and ICS 211), which was taught in java. At a certain point the book started getting past the level that I had learned in school and I fought the good fight for a while. Eventually it got to the point,even after numerous attempts, where I did not understand what I was reading. And I didn’t see the point of copying the code, moving on and hoping that I would just understand it later, so I stopped. Since then I have taken the program structure class at Manoa (ICS 212), where I was introduced to the C programming language and C++. The most valuable things I took from these languages was a better understanding what is happening in memory, and the knowledge of how compilation works.  I realize now that understanding why these languages are different than Javascript, is the key to understanding Javascript itself.  I hope that after completing my software engineering class at Manoa I can return to “Eloquent,” and establish full comprehension of its message. 

##Javascript and Syntax

I have nothing bad to say about javascripts syntax, though there are pieces of it that bother me, I don’t believe that disliking the syntax of a language is any grounds for saying that its a bad language (therefore there’s no point in bringing it up.) The main thing enjoy about Javascripts syntax is that when declaring a variable name you don’t have to specify a type.  A novice coder might point out that it’s not that hard to declare a type, and just cause you are not writing the type doesn’t mean that you don’t know what what type it's going to be used as(hopefully). I personally like this feature because in Java, C, and C++ creating functions and/or classes that take in arbitrary types can be very time consuming. This makes Javascript what they call a dynamic programing language.  The niche of a dynamic programing language is that they only catch errors at runtime. This can create problems, the error warning you’ll get when you have even a syntax error will be less informative than C or java.  Another feature in the syntax that I enjoy, and that I am certain everyone else enjoys are the “for of” and “for in” alternatives to the for loop.

##No classes? How utterly magnificent

It’s true javascript has no classes but it doesn’t lack class. What it has are objects which are types that store multiple types of actual data that can be accessed, added, or removed from the object at instantiation. Quite the step up from C++ and java where the only way this is possible is if you create a seperate child class that inherit from a mother, then if you create objects of that child class they will inherit traits from their mother class. But in Javascript you can literally just add and remove data as you please. This makes Javascript a prototype based language and what really happening when you manipulate data within an object is a process called cloning, in this case these clones of objects you are making are mutating to have various different traits.

I’m extremely excited to learn more about Javascript.  I hope to harness its mysterious power to do something great for humanity like create an old school JRPG(Japanese Style RPG). And With how well my software engineering class has gone so far in these first two weeks of school, I’m confident that I will be able to return to “eloquent” and finish it off.
