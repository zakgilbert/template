I’m baffled that just a few hundred years ago, a person might have been burned at the steak for asking the wrong questions.  These questions, a lot of the time, would have been considered good questions according to “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way?” by Eric Steven Raymond.  Raymond brings to light that now a days in the world of stack exchange and various web forums, the problem is a bit different.

## The Age of Questions
With the way the internet works nowadays, we basically have any information we could ever want, right at our fingertips. That is, if we can ask google or whatever the right question.  I’m reminded of a time when my moms Fox Terrier/Papillon mix Bella had began to go through labor. Now Bella is barley ten pounds and I’d say that these puppies she began pushing out were around a pound, so it wasn’t easy. Anyways the third puppy came out feet first, and when most of its body was out leaving only the head inside, there began to be a problem. After being stuck for a minute or two I could see that the puppy’s umbilical cord was no longer in use and the she was suffocating. I began to assist, but I didn’t want to hurt Bella or the puppy so it took me a couple minutes to get her out of there. I held the motionless newborn in my hands and feltn the coldness of death coming into its body. I was reminded of a family friend who had a stroke, and then aspirated, which is when your lungs fill up with your own fluid and you drown. I put the puppy down, opened up my chrome browser, and typed these exact words, “new born puppy aspirating what do?” First thing that popped up was a Youtube video where a vet cleary explains that you need to use a baby nasal aspirator (which somehow we had) to suck fluid out of the puppies nose and then hold the puppy head up facing away from you and slowing swing it downwards so its head is facing upside down. Back and forth, this uses centripetal force to give the puppy a modified Heimlich maneuver. After a few minutes the puppy let out a squeaky little cough and she has gone on to live a happy life with some family friends.

All thanks to the internet, and me asking the right question.  See all I did was follow the first step that Raymond gives you, which is search the web if you have problem, if your browser is leading you to things that are off subject, its most likely that your terminology is off cliter which in that case you should probably read the manual or talk to a friend. Because, ninety nine point nine percent of the time someone has already had this problem and there is extensive information online of what you can do to approach it. As for the point zero one percent; “Remember, there are many other users that are not experiencing your problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it while reading the documentation and searching the Web (you did do that before complaining, didn't you?). This means that very probably it is you who are doing something wrong, not the software.”

## My take on this Article

It’s my opinion that Raymonds article, could have an alternative title of “How to be an Effective Problem Solver.”  If you think about it, all problem solving is, is asking yourself the right questions, and realizing that when you can’t answer them, you’re gonna have to go search for the answers. If you apply Raymonds article to yourself it's very likely that you’ll never need to consult an online forum.  Raymond offers a wonderful philosophy on how to approach people for help, something I like to call humble assertiveness.  Some might see this as an oxymoron and that's because in our society assertiveness a lot of the time is associated with hubris. Which makes sense because there’s a lot of overly assertive losers out there. Rener Gracie of Gracie barra Jiu Jitsu really emphasizes how effective humble assertiveness can be in real life situations in his [Gracie Bullyproof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8isR_Y-kfk) video, a social technique that has nothing to do with fighting that he calls verbal Jiu Jitsu.  So in my belief, if you apply Raymond's teachings to everyday situations, you’ll be unstoppable in most social scenarios.

## I hate Stack Overflow
But now I’m realizing that most of the questions I’ve been searching for could be stupid questions, and I feel that there are a lot of trolls with nothing better to than lead people astray. People who know what they’re talking about are far less likely to answer your questions because they’re busy getting paid to be the smart people that they are. As Raymond said; “Those people most likely to be able to give you a useful answer are also the busiest people (if only because they take on the most work themselves).” I personally am at such a beginning level with my programming, that I haven’t yet had the ability to conjure up a true problem worth asking about. But I know this time will come so I’m extremely grateful for Raymond and his ways.

## A Good Question
This is the highest rated question on Stack Overflow at the moment. I think that it's a great question for Stack because for one it's not a about a bug, and two it’s mysterious, in that it’s a simple question about performance that people of all levels in computer scientist can understand, yet only people who understand coding are going to be able to answer it. Here it is….

[Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array)

## Why this is a good question
Its extremely clear that this user did not follow Raymonds first advice which is search the web. I smell troll, but perhaps a troll of the chaotic good sort. I believe this user understood the depth of this question and that he would receive a reply simply because it’s on the subject of Branch Prediction. Actually the top rated answer to this question he/or she points out that the real question he/ or she should be asking is “What is branch prediction?” Then they go on to explain it with a great analogy about a train and such, and then they point out what may be causing this problem in the persons code. 

The op (original poster) asked a simply worded question in the header, then underneath, gives a more specific explanation of what op’s problem is. Op formated their code, and and showed that they tried to fix their problem by implementing the code in a different language, which shows that they are not lazy and are truly trying to solve the problem. 

## A Bad Question

[What's the difference between JavaScript and Java?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/245062/whats-the-difference-between-javascript-and-java)

Not that I don’t believe this is a bad question, but there are so many resources online that can help you with this which is breaking Raymonds first rule so STFW.  This question implies that the op has never written code in either languages which means there's no real problem to be solved here. Are the Stack gods just supposed to descend from coding heaven and just explain everything to you. Op needs to show a little inertia and maybe at least do a “HelloWorld” in each programming languages before asking about the difference between them.  I think a better worded question would be, “As a beginner which Programming Language would be the best for me to start with?” But thats still push it as there so many resources out there that talk about this. My favorite response to this was “Java and Javascript are similar like Car and Carpet are similar.”

Raymonds Article is something I’ll never forget, it has made aware of a lot mistakes I’ve made not just on the internet but in real life. They should portray Raymonds teachings into a suitable curriculum for elementary school students.  In my opinion the sooner the better, because approaching social situations in a humbly assertive manner is no cake walk. It's got kind of a Zen feel to it, which I heard takes years to master. Now we live in this age of information and asking the right questions is far more important than knowing the right answers.
