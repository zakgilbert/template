I've spent the past week dabbling with the Semantic UI frame work.  Actually I don't think dabbling is the right word, lets try metaphor.  My first ecpiernce with Semantic UI has been like the first time you paint a wall and you think its gonna be easy and then you put way too much paint on the roller.  I guess that works, my point being, even though I have almost no html, css, or web design expiernce, I approached Semantic with such hubris, as I assumed that since I've learned programming that this should be a cakewalk.

## Why my approach was wrong
And you know it was a cakewalk, even after only a week I'm pretty confidnet I could make a fairly attrative website.  
I know that its completely up to me, but I can't help but think that I'm a victom of circumstance.  Having intermdeiate expirenece with C, C++, java, and java script, I assumed this would be a no brainer.  And it kinda was, but my standards for how a website looks arne't too high because I'm more concerned about what knowledge I can soak out of it. A Perfect exmaple is [“How to Ask Questions the Smart Way?”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven Raymond.  This contains some life changing insight yet the UI is as basic as it gets.  But as a web developer the cilent is not always going to give you content that you believe is worth broadcasting to the internet.  Thus the turd polishing comences, and the gods of medocirty are once again smilling down on you. But hey, its money, so who cares.

As for me, I'm not a web-developer, I enjoy more low level stuff, not because I think I'm better or smarter, I just like to pull things apart to know how they work, and I believe that developing at a lower level offers me more opertunity to be creative. Thus semantic (exspecily if you're also new to html and css) kinda blackboxes a lot of stuff out.  This is not a problem for most people, but it goes against my inquizitiveness and my yearning to design things from scratch.  So learning it has been a bit bumpy.  But I'm glad I did because if I do need to make a website, I'm pretty confidnet I can pull it off.

In my opinion, a framework exists to smooth out the learning curve of whatever it is you are creating, and once you have learned the framework you can save vast amounts of time.  But there still is a learning curve, there has to be, because the more you smooth out the learning curve, the more generic what ever it is you are creating will become, and this will make the "artists" angry. In all honesty it wouldn't bother me if all websites followed a general format, not as far as the content but as far as the user interface goes, I could care less.  The internet was invented with this idea of annoynomity where your ideals and personality can be magnifyed and who you are and what you like doesn't matter.  Therefore if all websites looked somewhat simallar then the content would be in the spotlight.  I feel the knowledge that the website brings to the table far out weighs the semantics of it.  How many times have you been to a website that's just beautiful, but you can't seem to find the thing you came there for.  You know its there, but you are looking in all the wrong places.  This is why slide shows of avovado toast and dropdown menus full of icons can easy ihibit the websites readability.  Then you have wesites like ebay and facebook pre-determined counter intuivtivness acts as a marketing stragy for the company.

But do you really want to smooth out the learning curve so much, will vetern web developers be hurt by this.  I think yes, not much you can do about it this is kinda the plight of innovation, the heros of the old times offen get forgotten and left behind. But hey that means we get to focus on more important stuff then why in the world is my rectangle not centered
