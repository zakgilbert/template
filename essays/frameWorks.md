I've spent the past week dabbling with the Semantic UI framework.  Actually I don't think dabbling is the right word, lets try metaphor.  My first experience with Semantic UI has been like the first time you paint a wall and you think it's gonna be easy and then you put way too much paint on the roller.  I guess that works, my point being, even though I have almost no html, css, or web design experience, I approached Semantic with such hubris, as I assumed that since I've learned programming that this should be a cakewalk.

## Why my approach was wrong
And you know it was a cakewalk, even after only a week I'm pretty confident I could make a fairly attractive website.  
I know that these things are completely up to me, but I can't help but think that I'm a victim of circumstance.  Having intermediate experience with C, C++, java, and javascript, I assumed this would be a no brainer.  And it kinda was, but my standards for how a website looks aren't too high because I'm more concerned about what knowledge I can soak out of it. A Perfect example is [“How to Ask Questions the Smart Way?”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven Raymond.  This contains some life changing insight yet the UI is as basic as it gets.  But as a web developer the client is not always going to give you content that you believe is worth broadcasting to the internet.  Thus the turd polishing commences, and the gods of mediocrity are once again smiling down on you. But hey, its money, so who cares.

As for me, I'm not a web-developer, I enjoy more low level stuff, not because I think I'm better or smarter, I just like to pull things apart to know how they work, and I believe that developing at a lower level offers me more opportunity to be creative. Thus semantic (especially if you're also new to html and css) kinda blackboxes a lot of stuff out.  This is not a problem for most people, but it goes against my inquisitiveness and my yearning to design things from scratch.  So learning it has been a bit bumpy.  But I'm glad I did because if I do need to make a website, I'm pretty confident I can pull it off.

In my opinion, a framework exists to smooth out the learning curve of whatever it is you are creating, and once you have learned the framework you can save vast amounts of time.  But there still is a learning curve, there has to be, because the more you smooth out the learning curve, the more generic whatever it is you are creating will become, and this will make the "artists" angry. In all honesty it wouldn't bother me if all websites followed a general format, not as far as the content but as far as the user interface goes, I could care less.  The internet was invented with this idea of anonymity where your ideals and personality can be magnified and who you are and what you like doesn't matter.  Therefore if all websites looked somewhat similar then the content would be in the spotlight.  I feel the knowledge that the website brings to the table far outweighs the semantics of it.  How many times have you been to a website that's just beautiful, but you can't seem to find the thing you came there for.  You know its there, but you are looking in all the wrong places.  This is why slideshows of avocado toast and drop down menus full of icons can easy inhibit the websites readability.  Then you have websites like ebay and facebook predetermined counter intuitiveness acts as a marketing strategy for the company.

But do you really want to smooth out the learning curve so much? Will veteran web developers be hurt by this.  I think yes, not much you can do about it this is kinda the plight of innovation, the heroes of the old times offen get forgotten and left behind. But hey that means we get to focus on more important stuff then why in the world is my rectangle not centered.
